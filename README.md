This repository provides a complete solution to build a linear regression model for estimating house prices using square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Developed in Python with pandas and NumPy, the project is organized as follows:

data_loader.py: Loads and prepares the data for training.

model.py: Defines and trains the linear regression model.

main.py: Serves as the main script tying together data loading and model execution.

house_prices.csv: Contains 250 house records, detailing square footage, bedroom/bathroom count, and selling price.
